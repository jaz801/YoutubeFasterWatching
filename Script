You need to use the Google Chrome browser.

If you never watch Youtube in 2x don't use this code!!!! You can't handle the speed. 

This is for people who crunch a 7 hour workshop in one session, for who 2x speed isn't fast enough.

Start with 2.6 speed then go to 2.3 speed, you trick your mind in thinking it is slower. But feel free to try different speeds. 
I have never tested it but I read somewhere that Youtube crashes between 6 and 9x but anyways that is far beyond human comprehension/interpreation speed.


Right Mouse Click -> Inspect -> Console. (cmd option J)



Enter and change the x:

          $('video').playbackRate=x



 To reset to normal close the tab
